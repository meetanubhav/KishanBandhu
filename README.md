Solution is to bring Indian farmers, local vendors, and landlords together in a common platform, so that it an inter communication channel could be established between them. 

Where the farmers could find that best land that suits them at their convenient price and has no pressure to pay more lately to landlord from the landlord. Also the farmers could select and approach the mandi once the crops are harvested and ready to bring to the market. While the crops are under the cultivation process the plantation needs and the machineries could be bought or taken at lease from the local vendors. They can use Agri credits which would be available on our platform which is being given as per the performance and engagement of the farmer. 

The local vendors are benefited as they would be recognized by the farmers and could attract farmers by giving them their offers and promotional discount.

The mandi is benefited as it has the track records of the farmers and their crops. 

While the farming process if the problem arise for the farmer then he/she can take expert advice and get their solutions which is available at the web app.

Also, there is a separate section for Government schemes under which the farmers and other stakeholders involved would know the various government schemes and benefits.

A chat forum is also there in the web application to see other person’s queries and thoughts and views on cultivation, harvesting and selling.

The workflow is such that -:
•	The web application will have a home page containing 
o	Signup/Login for different stakeholders
o	Section referring to current government schemes for farmers, retailers and landlords
o	Forum section showing the latest trends going on
•	Farmers on login/registration can have access to all the facilities such as land booking, mandi slot booking, leasing/purchasing necessary equipment’s/products for farming.
•	Landlords can post their lands if available for rental/lease
•	Local vendors can post their purchase offers on various products/goods. And also if machinery items are available for lease.
•	And special transaction feature where the transaction could made by the produce if the farmer has no money to pay to other aggregators. Simply entering his amount of produce the capital will be calculated and if the aggregators agree the transaction is made.
